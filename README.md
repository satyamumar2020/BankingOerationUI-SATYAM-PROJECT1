You are expected to complete the following requirements and give a 5 minute presentation of your project to our QC team. ## Requirements 1. Functionality should reflect the below user stories. 2. Data is stored in a database. 3. A custom stored procedure is called to perform some portion of the functionality. 4. Data Access is performed through the use of JDBC in a data layer consisting of Data Access Objects. 5. All input is received using the web UI. 6. Log4j is implemented to log events to a file. 7. A minimum of one (10) JUnit test is written to test some functionality. ## User Stories * As a user, I can login. * As a customer, I can apply for a new bank account with a starting balance. * As a customer, I can view the balance of a specific account. * As a customer, I can make a withdrawal or deposit to a specific account. * As the system, I reject invalid transactions. * Ex: * A withdrawal that would result in a negative balance. * A deposit or withdrawal of negative money. * As an employee, I can approve or reject an account. * As an employee, I can view a customer's bank accounts. * As a user, I can register for a customer account. * As a customer, I can post a money transfer to another account. * As a customer, I can accept a money transfer from another account. * A an employee, I can view a log of all transactions.
